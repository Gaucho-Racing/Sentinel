Sentinel is the backbone of Gaucho Racing's authentication and access management system.
It streamlines member onboarding, offboarding, and provides secure single sign-on (SSO) capabilities for all internal team applications.
At its core, Sentinel maintains a directory of active team members and their associated information, streamlining the processes of onboarding and offboarding within the organization.

Sentinel also provides single sign-on (SSO) access to the team's internal applications.
By implementing OAuth 2.0, applications can securely authenticate members and retrieve relevant information through the Sentinel API. This centralized approach simplifies the user experience while providing applications with up-to-date member information.
